                When I initially moved into Manhattan, I thought I was running into a fanatical city of crazy energy: I saw huge buildings, flocks of people, crowded transit systems, and even massive electronic billboards that were
                hung all around Times Square. However, I questioned my idea of New York City when I stumbled upon the heart of Manhattan: Central Park. Upon entering Central Park, I entered a completely different dimension. All the
                repetitive, tiresome sounds of sirens, horns, and traffic on the main streets were gone. The sight of absurdly-sized crowds commuting in the streets and mountains of cars being stuck in traffic were gone. The gruesome
                smell of marijuana tainting the air was gone. The existence of towering buildings were technically within sight but inside of Central Park were gone. The crazy energy that New York City was typically all about was
                gone. Instead, I found myself in one of the most, if not the most, relaxing urban parks of New York City.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text card-indent">
                Although the city lights, buildings, and infrastructure in Manhattan were beautiful, the beauty of Central Park was something that I resonated with to an even further extent. Because my first encounter of Central Park
                was during the spring, I saw an abundance of nature: everywhere was lit with predominantly green colors, while being faintly accompanied by the other variations of vivid colors nature had to offer. Countless numbers of
                trees, multitudes of rocks of all sizes, and acres of grass were within my sight in every single direction. Venturing even farther into Central Park, I saw a pond out in the open—glistening directly above the sun—which
                consisted of small groups of ducks swimming together in connected lines.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text card-indent">
                On the hills of Central Park, I saw people lying down, bathing in the rays of the sun as their bodies tightly bonded to the grass and their heads faced straight up into the plain blue sky. I also saw people taking a
                more active approach as they took part in all sorts of recreational activities, such as football, soccer, volleyball, and even bouldering. Despite the fact that their fatigue was apparent and the sweat on their bodies
                were reflecting heavily off the sunlight, it had only brought about excitement, laughter, and wide-open smiles on their faces. Otherwise, I saw an array of people sitting down and standing up, talking to their friends
                and loved ones in the relaxing, cheerful atmosphere that was Central Park.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text card-indent">
                When I took a moment to listen, I only heard the sounds of birds gleefully chirping, in addition to people chatting and laughing. The ridiculous noises of traffic and odors of weed were all out of range and out of sight.
                What was incredible was that my ears could not be irritated nor my sense of smell could be disturbed; while being at Central Park, my body was naturally adjusting to perfect equilibrium. It was the existence of such a
                different, soothing place in New York City that made myself naturally destress and unwind.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text card-indent">
                Being at Central Park, I had nothing but a sense of wanting to know more. As I walked around, it felt like a never-ending cycle of captivation: there were stunning landscapes, delightful recreational areas, and arousing
                monuments to explore. Of course, I always took a moment to take in the scenery and enchantment that each part of Central Park had to offer. Since Central Park piqued my interest from the first time around, I would
                repeatedly come to Central Park again and again, only to grow fond of it even more and more. Central Park was growing on me to the extent where I not only continued to do some of the same activities as before, but I did
                new ones as well.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text card-indent">
                For instance, I went ice skating for my first time at Wollman Rink with my friends. I loved sharing the experiences with my group of friends of learning ice skating, tripping and falling on our butts, and flailing on
                the ice hopelessly; it was quite the hilarious experience. Furthermore, I went to the Central Park Zoo to be met by a diversity of fascinating creatures. From the sea lions to the grizzly bears to the penguins to the
                leopards, it was absolutely a swell time to be able to walk around and examine the unique assets of each animal.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text card-indent">
                Ever since that day, the first step I took into the heart of Manhattan, it was just me and the park. It was me who decided the path I would take. It was me who recognized the potential of the park for my own sake. As I
                continued to spend more time in the park, before I knew it, Central Park was my beloved New York: it was my home.
